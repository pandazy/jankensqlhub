# Release Notes v1.2.1

## 📚 **Documentation Improvements**

### README.md Reorganization

Complete reorganization of README.md for improved readability and progressive disclosure:

**Structural Changes:**
- ✅ Added Table of Contents with anchor links
- ✅ Progressive disclosure: basic → intermediate → advanced
- ✅ Split large JSON examples into smaller, focused examples
- ✅ Added reference tables throughout (syntax, types, constraints, errors)
- ✅ Clear section separation with horizontal rules

**New Content Sections:**

1. **"Why JSON-Configured Queries?"**
   - Emphasizes centralized query definitions
   - Co-locating SQL with constraints for maintainability
   - Easy auditing of all database operations

2. **"Non-Invasive Design"**
   - Clarifies this is a focused utility, not a framework
   - Works alongside raw SQL, ORMs, or any database access pattern
   - Gradual adoption supported

3. **"Acknowledgments"**
   - Credits [Cline](https://cline.bot/) AI coding agent for development assistance

1. Overview (why, non-invasive design, capabilities)
2. Quick Start (30-second working example)
